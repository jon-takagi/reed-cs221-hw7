## Introduction
In this experiment, we verified that the conservation of momentum holds for collisions in 2 dimensions. We used an air table to control frictional forces as we took video of several collisions. By analyzing the video of the collisions, we were able to identify the center of mass of the system and track its velocity. Because the mass of the system is constant, we could calculate the momentum of the system before and after the collisions.

## Procedure
First, we identified a level and even section of the air table by identifying areas where an initally stationary puck remained stationary.
Then, we mounted the camera on a tripod so that it could capture a wide area around our area.
Next, we measured the mass (to calculate the momentum) and diameter (to scale the video) of each puck.
We then performed 3 types of collision, taking a few trials of each. First, we hit a stationary puck with a moving puck. Second, we had two pucks moving in the same general direction bounce off each other. Third, we crashed two pucks head on.
Using Tracker, we found the velocity of each puck and the corresponding uncertainty.
